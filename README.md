Login-Splash
============

This program is launched on system login and appears as a screen-grabbing splash screen displaying a editable text message on which the user can either accept or reject logging in to the computer. If the user rejects the terms of entry, the computer will automatically logout.  Created by Craig Lotter, March 2005
